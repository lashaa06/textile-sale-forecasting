#  Textile Sales Forecasting using SARIMA (1964–1980)

> A time-series forecasting project using a simulated dataset to model monthly garment sales and predict future demand trends in the textile industry.

---

## Overview

This project involves the development of a **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)** model to forecast **monthly sales of garments** from **January 1973 to December 1980** based on simulated historical sales data from **1964 to 1972**.

Due to data confidentiality during internship, a synthetic dataset was generated to closely reflect real-world seasonal trends, upward growth, and volatility seen in garment manufacturing sales cycles.

##  Objective:

- Simulate monthly garment sales data to mimic industry behavior  
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Apply SARIMA model for seasonal forecasting  
- Visualize historical vs. predicted future sales  
- Provide business inferences for inventory and production planning
